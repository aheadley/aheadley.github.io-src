So I was bored today and cludged together a little URL
shortener/redirecter/whatever-you-want-to-call-it:

http://xen.im/

It uses hexadecimal for the ID numbers though it would take all of a few
seconds to change it to use any other system. I was pretty disappointed
with how long it took me to get working right, I'm much rustier than I
thought.

While I was working on this I decided it was about time to figure out
how to use some kind of version control (this is kind of a lie, I
actually tried to figure it out last night). Since we recently had
someone request Subversion be installed at work I decided to go with
that. It's pretty nifty even if it did take me the better part of the
day to figure out and get it working the way I wanted.

Maybe all this will get me interested in working on some of my other
projects again! (haha, yeah right)
