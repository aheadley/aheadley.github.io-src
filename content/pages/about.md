Hi, I'm Alex and this is my dumping ground for when I find something
interesting or just feel like writing. Updates can be... sporadic, to
say the least. As a junior sysadmin/programmer by day, and avid
anime-watcher/gamer/general dork by night I mostly write about tech
stuff but there's also the occasional rant about why something or other
sucks.
