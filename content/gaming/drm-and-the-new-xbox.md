There's a lot of talk about the new Xbox One on the interwebs. I don't
play my Xbox 360 much anymore (I think it RRoD'd? I don't remember) so I
wasn't planning on getting the new one. Then I read an article on  the
[Penny Arcade
Report](http://penny-arcade.com/report/article/the-death-of-used-games-and-control-of-the-second-hand-market-could-be-the)
about how the new DRM and death of used game sales was actually a *good*
thing, and **my brain came to a screeching halt**. I... what?

That sounds pretty crazy, but let's give him the benefit of the doubt
and see the reasons this is a good thing:

Yes, because pirating games on the Xbox 360 is rampant and has clearly
killed the console. I mean no one makes games for it anymore. No wait,
that's completely wrong and stupid. Ok, but the end of piracy
(*\*snort\*)* is a good thing for me (the consumer). How? Why would I
give a shit if someone else pirates the game? I guess it kind of sucks
that I paid \$60 and they paid \$0 but that doesn't actually affect
anything in the game... so how does this benefit me exactly? Oh, it
doesn't, **at all**.

I'm not a developer or publisher, I'm a consumer; I don't give two shits
about what is great for developers and publishers. Also, has the average
new game price *ever* come down (excluding market crashes)? So this guy
is suggesting that all these publishers are going to suddenly grow
hearts of gold and willingly lower their prices? Am I being trolled
here? It's getting hard to tell.

You mean like the cheap used games that already exist? Yes, we should
definitely let publishers decide the older game prices because they
*might* lower them! You know, instead of letting the used game market
compete for lower prices. Is this guy for real?

So because games are too expensive now, let's make them *more*
expensive? Does anyone in their right mind really believe publishers are
going to offer anything but shovelware for the \$5 and \$10 deals you
can get at GameStop and the like **right now** (or at least anyone that
isn't *already* doing that through Xbox Arcade)? Oh right, the previous
quote. This must be a troll, no one can legitimately be this stupid.

My brain just exploded. **GAME LICENSING IS PRACTICALLY THE DEFINITION
OF ARTIFICIAL SHORTAGE**. How much do you fucking think it costs to
provide a download of a fucking game? PRO FUCKING TIP: It's nearly
nothing. Oh wait, he's not actually talking about *artificial
shortages*, he's talking about **limited production of material goods**.
See, those are different words and words have meanings and when you use
one word to talk about something that isn't meant by that word people
get confused, or they just decide that you're a fucking moron. Does he
honestly think publishers aren't going to have *Pro Limited Extreme
Edition* versions of games for the first 500 super special buyers (or
whatever) just because they can make as many of those versions as they
want? They can already do that, the factory in China that makes the
little figures that come with the super special edition will make as
many of them as the publisher asks, they don't give a shit. They don't
do that now because the *entire point* of the super special edition is
that not everyone has it.

Ok, so the reasons he gives in the article are *completely* retarded.
Whatever, fine, I'm not going to buy it anyway, but I want to address a
few other things. There have been a lot of comparisons to Steam
(especially on this [Slashdot
thread](http://games.slashdot.org/story/13/05/24/137220/xbox-one-used-game-policy-leaks-publishers-get-a-cut-of-sale)).
I like Steam, a lot, but it certainly has its flaws. However, what
Microsoft (and a lot of these journalists) seem to miss is that Steam
has benefits **for the consumer** that make the DRM trade-off
worthwhile. With this new DRM scheme, what do I get out of it? It sounds
like I'll just be paying more. I'm reminded of a [skit by Lewis
Black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1QRAXv9vUs):

Every time a new DRM scheme comes out there's talk about how "*this*
time we'll stop piracy for sure!", and game prices will come down and
sales will go up and we'll end hunger and war and everything will be
puppies and rainbows. And everytime it's **bullshit**; it's just some
new way to annoy the legitimate customers.

One last thing: what happens to all your Xbox One games when Microsoft
shuts down the Xbox Live servers in five to ten years? Keep in mind
there is already a precedent for this with the original Xbox servers
being [shut
down](http://kotaku.com/5464818/microsoft-no-more-original-xbox-games-over-xbox-live)
a while ago. I still play 10+ year old games on my Playstation 2, but
will I be able to do that on the Xbox One? Will there even be any games
with that kind of staying power on it, or will it just be full of *Call
of Duty 5: Black Ops 4: The Revenge 2*?

*P.S.* I generally like the articles on the PAR. This one was just so
mind bogglingly dumb that I had to write something.

*P.P.S.* Pretty much everything said above will probably also apply to
the new PlayStation, so Sony fans can curb their pre-emptive gloating.
