You know what this site needs? If you answered "hookers and blow", then
you are technically correct (the best kind), but I was thinking "blog
posts about anime and manga I've been reading". I stopped reading manga
for a while just because I didn't have any particularly interesting ones
in my list and it's kind of a pain to check for new chapter releases but
then I found a whole bunch of good ones so here we are:

-   Asamiya-san no Imouto - A story about a little (robot) girl who is
    wandering around a post-apocalyptic-ish world and the people she
    meets. Sort of like Kino no Tabi but less dark and more moe.
-   Full Metal Panic! Sigma - It's more Full Metal Panic!, what more
    could you need?
-   Witch Craft Works - A tall girl is smitten with a (straight) short
    guy and treats him like a princess. The story is not very original
    but I like it for the role-reversal and the art is really nice.
-   Boys on the Run - 20-something loser mans the fuck up and becomes a
    boxer. I am apparently a sucker for depressing realism or something.
-   Again!! - A guy who wasted his high school life goes through a time
    loop and gets a second chance. Strangely addicting but there aren't
    enough chapters out to say whether it's actually good or not yet.
-   Trinity 7 - Uh, guy does magic or something. Plot is not really this
    one's strong point, it's more about the PLOT (if you know what I
    mean, \*wink\* \*wink\* \*nudge\* \*nudge\* say no more etc.). TL
    Note: PLOT means fanservice.
-   Kono S O Mi Yo - Dude has a birthmark on his ass that makes any
    woman who sees it want to sleep with him, once and only once. In
    spite of the incredibly stupid sounding premise, the relationships
    are handled so well that they make it a worthwhile read.
-   Sakuranbo Syndrome - By the same author as Kono S O Mi Yo, girl has
    a rare disease that makes her regress in age unless she swaps spit
    with a particular guy (who already has a girlfriend). Again, the
    characters and relationships make this interesting even with a
    premise that nearly has my eyes rolling out of their sockets.
-   Oyasumi Punpun - I could probably write a post just about this one;
    unfortunately it would be mostly "it's just like, so good, man"
    because I can't write for shit. If you've ever read something and
    then at the end thought "holy shit, that was amazing, life-changing
    even!" but didn't change your life or well, much of anything (a
    short lived epiphany) then you know how I felt after reading this. I
    walked outside and paced up and down the walk thinking "jesus
    christ, that... that was about me. What am I doing with myself? I've
    gotta do something with my life". I'd love to say I then immediately
    quit my job and took my life savings and lived my childhood dream or
    something but no, nothing really happened. Real change is not so
    easy I suppose. Still, it is without a doubt, the best thing I have
    ever read (on a personal level).
-   Solanin - By the same author as Oyasumi Punpun. A 20-something girl
    learns how to deal with life sucking. I'm not actually sure I would
    recommend this. It's not bad, but it doesn't really hold up in the
    face of Oyasumi Punpun. It's just not fleshed out enough or
    something.

Now, for anime since the last season update I posted about (which was
apparently more than a year ago so I'm definitely going to forget some):

-   Chihayafuru - Girl plays weird Japanese card game. For being a about
    a weird card game, this show was suprisingly enjoyable. I can't put
    my finger on any one part of it being what made it great, just the
    whole package was really good.
-   Fate/Zero - Prequel to Fate/Stay Night. The entire time I was
    watching this, I couldn't stop thinking "this is what Fate/Stay
    Night should have been".
-   Kamisama Dolls - Aside from the main girls completely ridiculous
    tits, this was pretty fun. Also had a really great OP.
-   Usagi Drop - 30-ish guy psuedo-adopts his grandfather's illegitimate
    daughter. I really loved this manga, right up until the timeskip
    which sends it into WTF territory, and since the anime didn't cover
    up to the timeskip it was great!
-   Tatami Galaxy - Guy tries to experience a rose-colored college life.
    The entire show is a build-up to the last episode, and it is totally
    worth it.
-   Natsume Yuujinchou - Kid can see and talk to spirit things that
    other people can't. Very laid back and enjoyable, much like Aria.

Older anime I've watched or am watching recently:

-   Legend of Galactic Heroes - This is the space opera of space operas.
    Starts slow, but is completely amazing so far.
-   Master Keaton - Urusawa is some kind of crazy genious. Definitely
    worth watching if you like his other works.
-   Now and Then, Here and There - Kid gets pulled into a world with a
    serious water shortage. Jesus fuck was this depressing.
-   Banner/Crest of the Stars - Kid goes on space adventures with his
    space elf waifu. A really great sci-fi show, like LoGH but not as
    vast/epic (in the classic sense of the word).
