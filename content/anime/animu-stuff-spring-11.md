First, the score from last season:

-   Madoka Magica: Holy shit, this turned out to be awesome. Probably
    wouldn't like it as much if I rewatched though, part of the magic
    was the speculah on /a/.
-   Fractale: This was just... mediocre. Yamakan failed to save anime.
-   Hourou Musuko: Great. Just great.
-   Korea Zombie Desk Car: I don't even remember what this show's real
    name is. It was hilarious until the DRAMA started towards the end
    and it got pretty boring.
-   Everything else was stupid and/or bad.

Now, on to this season's shows:

-   Ano Hana: This could be really good. Right now it's heading that way
    but ~~Index~~ Menma is so annoying that she really drags down the
    rest of the show.
-   Ao no Exorcist: This seems like kind of generic. Just not very
    interesting.
-   Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko: YA YAYA YA YA YAYA- I mean, goddamn
    that OP song is addicting. The show itself seems pretty fun too.
-   Hanasaku Iroha: Seems to be a well done feel-good show so far. Not
    ground-breaking, just well done.
-   Hen Zemi: WTF am I watching, but still hilarious.
-   Kaiji S2: I never finished the first season and this one's not
    looking to do too well either.
-   Maria+Holic Alive: If you liked the first season, this is more of
    the same. Wish they would focus on Mariya some more though.
-   Nichijou: Moe overload, not bad though.
-   Steins;Gate: This show is probably my favorite of the season, which
    is kind of weird since I though Chaos;Head was stupid. It's
    hilarious when it's being funny, and interesting when it's being
    serious. I love all the characters, even the bad characters (looking
    at you Mayushi) in this show are good. I could listen to MC and
    what's-her-face-with-the-red-hair bicker forever and still not be
    tired of it. Hopefully the VN translation project will be successful
    so I can check that out.

Dropped:

-   C The Money blah blah blah: This is like any generic shounen shit,
    but with money.
-   Moshidora: Terrible animation, and it's just boring.
-   30-sai blah blah Forever a Virgin: This had a couple of funny
    moments but over all it was just annoying.
-   Sket Dance: I didn't even make it half way through the first
    episode. Annoying and stupid.
-   Deadman Wonderland: This show. It's like, there might, maybe,
    possibly be an interesting concept in there somewhere but it's deep
    under layers of retardedness.
