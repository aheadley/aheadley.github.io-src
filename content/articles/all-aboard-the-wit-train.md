I just stole some guy's idea and registered "isslashdotshittytoday.com"
and "doesslashdotsucktoday.com" after reading some post on slashdot.
Only a static html page for now (you can guess what it says) but I will
probably put up some kind of mechanism to check whether slashdot.org is
loading to decide the answer. Maybe I should check for whether there's a
kdawson post on the front page? Speaking of him,
"doeskdawsonsuck(today).com" is up for grabs too...
