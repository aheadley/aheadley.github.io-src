Ok, so the fall season was pretty good with:

-   Kuragehime: This was definitely my favorite show this season. It
    wasn't groundbreaking or even especially creative I suppose, just
    very well done. The extra Amars were typical hat-wearing extras but
    they were still fun and the main characters were golden. Just a good
    fun watch.
-   Panty & Stocking: Lewd/Crass but hilarious. Pretty much every
    episode got a laugh out of me, although I don't know how much of
    that was just from shock factor (I can't believe they're putting
    this on TV).
-   Soredemo Machi Wa Mawatteiru: SHAFT, but not quite as crazy as some
    of their other stuff. It was fun and enjoyable but also "if you like
    SHAFT you'll like this". Also, I actually reeled back when
    what's-her-face with the teeth spoke for the first time.
-   OreImo: I think I was most excited about this show since I had been
    following the few chapters of the mango that had been scanlated but
    eh, it kind of felt lackluster. It was still good and I'm glad I
    watched it (especially for the "GUNKA GUNKA" and other Kuroneko
    moments) but I feel it could have been better.
-   Arakawa Under the Bridge x2: Loved it, although it was kind of
    annoying how they never went anywhere with the "going to Venus"
    thing.
-   Ika Musume: Fun but forgettable.
-   Bakuman: I'm glad this got animated I guess since I liked the manga,
    but I didn't watch past the first episode or two because it was
    moving slower than molasses on cold glass.
-   A Certain Magical Background Character: Watching for Biribiri, and
    that's pretty much it.
-   SnO Forte: I liked the first season and started out watching this
    one, but tiny nun was just annoying so I ended up dropping it.
-   Everything else was shit for one reason or another.

Winter season is turning out to be a load of shit. So far:

-   Rio - Rainbow Gate: I had no idea what this was, and it turned out
    to be crap. Just felt like a bad T&A fanservice-fest.
-   Madoka Magica: I don't know if I'll end up dropping this or not. I
    don't like magical girl shows but it's SHAFT so maybe they'll do
    something interesting with it. We'll see.
-   Infinite Stratos: Oh wow, this is so terrible and generic. It's
    really like they just copy+pasted the script from other stuff and
    put zero thought into the setting (or anything else). I mean, giant
    robots doing those stupid kendo sword-swinging excersizes? I may
    just end up watching this if it can keep up the so-bad-it's-good
    thing.
-   GOSICK: This looked like it would be awesome during the OP, then it
    turned out to be boring. Will probably give it another episode or
    two before dropping.
-   Freezing: My thoughts on this are kind of mixed. On the one hand,
    it's nice to see a serious-fucken-business grimdark show taking
    itself seriously. On the other hand, the male lead seems to be an
    obnoxious moron. But hey, it's the first episode so we'll see how it
    goes!
-   Onii-chan no Name to Fucking Longu: HA HA HA INCEST with bad art.
-   Mitsudomoe 2: The first episode was actually hilarious, but I
    probably won't watch the rest because I didn't like the first
    season.
-   Beelzebub: Slapstick comedy is probably a "love it or hate it" kind
    of thing, and I didn'tÂ  love it.
-   Yumekui Merry: Wasn't actually bad, just wasn't very interesting so
    wasn't good either. Maybe it'll pick up later.

Waiting to checkout Fractale and Hourou Musuko, will probably checkout
Dragon Crisis and the Zombie thing for lack of anything better to do as
well.
